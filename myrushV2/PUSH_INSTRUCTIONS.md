# How to Push to GitHub

The automatic push failed because the GitHub account `harsha630` does not have permission to write to the repository `Ajay1234566890/MYRUSH-USER-APP`.

## Steps to Fix

1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that `harsha630` is added as a collaborator to the repository `Ajay1234566890/MYRUSH-USER-APP` on GitHub.
   
2. **Or Switch Accounts**: If you want to push as `Ajay1234566890`, you need to sign out of the current GitHub account in your terminal/VS Code.

## Try Pushing Again

Once you have resolved the permissions, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

If you are prompted to login, use the account that owns the repository.
